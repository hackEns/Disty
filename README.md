Disty
=====

Disty is a [hackEns](http://hackens.org) project by [Phyks](http://phyks.me)
and [Elie](http://exppad.com/) aiming at building a low-cost telepresence robot
for videoconference.

More infos can be found on the [project page](http://hackens.org/disty) (in
French). The README and the source code is another good source of
documentation, which should be self-explanatory, in English.

This repo contains all the drawings and code we used to make it work.
